    "# Hands-On Assignment 2\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in Module 2, machine learning is about optimizing over a loss.\n",
    "How well a machine learning model performs depends on both the hypothesis and loss function that we choose to use.\n",
    "This general framework of goes under the name of *[empirical risk minimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_risk_minimization)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will walk you through the basic steps of empirical risk minimization: the optimization problem at the heart of most modern-day machine learning systems.\n",
    "We will use a simple motivating example for an end-to-end demonstration: predicting whether a patient with a given antigen test value is infected with Covid-19.\n",
    "Using the same synthetic Covid-19 dataset you worked with in [Hands-On Assignment 1](https://github.com/ucsc-cse-40/HO1),\n",
    "we will train a simple [classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification) that predicts that an individual is infected with Covid-19 if and only if their test value is above a certain threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is divided into three parts:\n",
    "1. We will first set up a basic empirical risk minimization problem.\n",
    "2. Next, we will find a hypothesis that results in a small loss.\n",
    "3. Finally, we will evaluate our solution and the associated risks of deployment."

    "## Part 1: Setting up the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part we will setup the empirical risk minimization problem we wish to solve, by:\n",
    " - Defining our variables of interest.\n",
    " - Choosing a \"hypothesis class\" $ \\mathcal{H} $, or space of possible solutions, that we will search.\n",
    " - Selecting a \"loss function\" $ L $ that will be minimized by our learned solution, thus encoding our objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Empirical Risk Minimization - The Big Picture\n",
    "\n",
    "Empirical risk minimization is about trying to come up with a function (usually called a *hypothesis*) that can make correct predictions as often as possible.\n",
    "The more our hypothesis is correct, the lower the *risk* of that hypothesis.\n",
    "A hypothesis that is always correct has zero risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in real life, it's almost always impossible to make something that is always correct.\n",
    "(If we could, there would be no point in machine learning.)\n",
    "It's also impossible for us to always know when our hypothesis is right or wrong (imagine trying to predict something for every person in the world (past, present, and future)).\n",
    "\n",
    "So since we can't compute the true risk of a hypothesis, we instead approximate it by computing an *empirical risk*.\n",
    "To do this, we narrow down our set of data points from every possible data point to a known set of training data.\n",
    "We can then compute our average loss over our known data to compute our empirical risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Empirical Risk Minimization - Mathematical Formalism\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's put our intuition from the previous section into math.\n",
    "\n",
    "Empirical risk minimization is the **minimization** (over several possible hypotheses $\\mathcal{H}$) of the expected loss (i.e. *risk*) of a hypothesis $ h $ with the data $ Z $:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\min_{h \\in \\mathcal{H}} \\mathbb{E}_Z \\Big[ L(Z, h) \\Big]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are taking the [expectation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) ($ \\mathbb{E} $) over all possible values of the data.\n",
    "If you havenâ€™t seen expectation before, we will discuss it in detail in a future module.\n",
    "But for now, you can think of expectation as the average value we would get if we randomly sampled infinite data points.\n",
    "For example, if we fairly picked random numbers between 1 and 99 (inclusive),\n",
    "then the expected value (expectation) would be 50.\n",
    "You can make a small Python program to try it out yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a finite set of empirical data $ Z = \\{z_1, z_2, z_3, ..., z_N \\} $, we can say that:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}_{Z} \\Big[ L(Z, h) \\Big] \\approx \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N L(z_i, h)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in our equation, we are dividing the loss by the number of data points, $ N $.\n",
    "This allows us to compute the *expected loss*,\n",
    "which is the amount that we expect each prediction to be off by.\n",
    "Another common way of using loss, that you may have seen in class,\n",
    "is using the *total loss*.\n",
    "The total loss is computed the same as the expected loss, but does not average over all data points (doesn't divide by $ N $).\n",
    "Using either the expected or total loss leads to the same answer for this problem.\n",
    "In the future, we will discuss when using one would be more appropriate than the other."

    "For this task, we are given previous examples of asymptomatic patients (and their Covid-19 infection status),\n",
